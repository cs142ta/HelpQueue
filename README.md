HelpQueue
The help queue for CS 142.
The queue is used as a structured method for students to request and receive help.
It utilizes PHP and JS with a SQLite3 database datastore.

The queue was originally written for CS 240 but since it seemed effective, a lot of other CS classes have since copied it.

This version has been modified specifically for CS 142 by Nathan Shurtz in  Fall 2018, but the modifications could be beneficial to the other classes.

The hope is that improvments can continue to be made and a record of the changes can be kept in this repository.
